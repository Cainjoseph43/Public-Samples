# Public Samples
This repo is for any public published samples from presentations or blog articles.

Please feel free to utilize the code at will.  As such there are no garantees that any code provided in this repo will function properly in all cases, and is meant for educational use only.

USE INSTRUCTIONS: Unless otherwise stipulated all of these examples are intended to be run inside the context of a SharePoint site collection. Where a 3rd party library was used I make an effort to point to a public CDN where available. Many of these examples have references to custom files that would be stored in a library in a site collection in my own tenant.  Please make sure you review the locataions of all reference libraries and make sure to adjust accordingly to your own needs.
